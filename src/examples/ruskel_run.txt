Claude: As an AI language model, I don't have feelings in the same way that humans do. I don't experience emotions like happiness, sadness, or anger. My purpose is to provide information and assist users to the best of my abilities based on the data I have been trained on. I am here to help and support you, but I don't have the capacity for emotional states.
